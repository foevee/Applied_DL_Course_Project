## Cancer Detection on Camleyon16 Chanllenge Data

This is the project trying to re-implement the ideas in the paper "Detecting Cancer Metastases on
Gigapixel Pathology Images" [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02442). 

The images data are from Camelyon16 Chanllenge using Neural Networks to detect the cancer cells from the tissues. 
This project followed the same idea to utilize transfer learning on pre-trained VGG19 model for image classification. 
It divides into 3 parts:
   1. Data processing:
   2. Model training:
   3. Model evaluation: use metrics like accuracy, AUROC and also visualize using heatmap.
